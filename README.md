## Faq
#### Doesnt 1024 height cause a lot of lag?
##### - It shouldnt cause any major lag on your server and perhaps only a small increase in loading time but that should be it!

#### What versions do we support?
##### - We support everything in between 1.19.4 > 1.21

#### What hardware do i need to run this?
##### - Anything should be fine as long as you pregen and have 4gb+ ram on the server!

#### Does this require any dependencies?
##### - This is a pack for the Iris Dimension Engine and you will need Iris to run this.

#### Why is it in a Beta?
##### - There are still many areas for improvement, and it is nowhere near finished!

## How to use

### RRT > v1000+

**installation Guide**
- *Turn off the server*
- unzip `RRT-Special_Beta-vXXXX.zip` and put that in `plugins/iris/packs` 
- *turn on the server*
- it should restart automatically or turn the server off if it doesnt give me a ping.
- start the server and run `/iris create type=rrtspecial name=<name>`
- And that should be it!

**trouble shooting**
- if its stuck on 0% and crashes then run the command via console or if server crashed and created the wolrd file then delete the worldfile and restart the server it should automatically recreate the world without crashing 
- dont use multiverse instead use the latest myworlds jar or phantomworlds
